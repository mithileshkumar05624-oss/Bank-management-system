Bank Management System is a web-based application built using Python (Flask) for backend and HTML/CSS for frontend. It allows users to create accounts, log in securely, view balances, deposit money, withdraw money, transfer funds, and view transaction history.

Flask handles routing, server logic, and database connectivity, while HTML/CSS create a clean and interactive user interface. The system ensures data validation, secure password storage, and proper session management. This project helped me understand full-stack development, CRUD operations, authentication, and building real-world financial applications.
